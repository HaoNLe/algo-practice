  DESCRIPTION
    Given the root of a binary tree, the value of a target node target, and an integer k,
    return an array of the values of all nodes that have a distance k from the target node.

    You can return the answer in any order.

  CONSTRAINTS
    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 500].
    0 <= Node.val <= 500
    All the values Node.val are unique.
    target is the value of one of the nodes in the tree.
    0 <= k <= 1000

  EXAMPLES
    Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, k = 2
    Output: [7,4,1]
    Explanation: The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5) have
                 values 7, 4, and 1.

    Input: root = [1], target = 1, k = 3
    Output: []
